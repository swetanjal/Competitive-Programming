# Competitive Programming

This repository contains a bunch of interesting problems I have solved in various Programming contests as well as a Codebook which contains Object Oriented implementation of standard Algorithms and Data Structures

In most of the directories, you will find two subdirectories
- 'Solved Problems' : Contains problems which I could solve myself
- 'Upsolved Problems' : Contains problems which I solved myself after referring to the editorial/solution

In most Competitive Programming platforms, I go with the username 'swetanjal'. Take a look at my profiles for solutions to more problems solved by me!
